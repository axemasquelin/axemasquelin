### About Me:

Dedicated Radiology K00 Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women's Hospital, located in Boston, Massachusetts. My passion lies in pioneering research at the intersection of radiology, artificial intelligence, and precision medicine.
### Research Focus:

  ___Machine Learning in Data-Scarce Domains:___ Leveraging advanced algorithms to address challenges in areas with limited data availability.  
  ___Early Detection of Lung Cancer:___ Harnessing deep learning techniques to detect and classify indeterminate pulmonary nodules, particularly those ranging from 4-20mm in diameter.  
  ___Pulmonary and Critical Care:___ Contributing to advancements in pulmonary care through innovative research and methodologies.

#### Central Hypothesis:

Current research revolves around amplifying the focus of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) on LDCT features acknowledged as clinically significant, in order to enhance the generalizability of the DNN to new images.  

#### Academic Achievements:

I hold a doctorate from the University of Vermont, where I was honored with prestigious NIH fellowships, including F31, T32, and F99. These fellowships were instrumental in advancing the classification accuracy of indeterminate pulmonary nodules. My overarching objective has been to mitigate patients' exposure to unnecessary invasive procedures and subsequent scans, thereby enhancing their quality of life.
