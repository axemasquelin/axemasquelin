### Introduction:
#### I am a trained biomedical engineer focused on the utilization of machine learning and mathematical modeling to improve diagnostic outcomes for patients. My current work primarily explores the use of deep learning for early lung cancer detection. Specifically, we are interested in finding novel methodologies to improve the performance of deep neural network on data-scarce domains. In recent work, we have utilized wavelet decompositions to reduce the number of examples needed for a deep learning algorithm to learn. Other fields of research included differentiation between Tuberculosis and lung cancer nodule from CT and X-ray images, and the application of pharmacokinetics to model drug dispersion/absorption within pulmonary nodules. My work has allowed me to collaborate extensively with numerous other investigators within the Cellular, Molecular, and Biomedical Sciences (CMB), Complex System Center, and the College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences (CEMS) at the University of Vermont.
