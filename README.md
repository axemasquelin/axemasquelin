### Introduction:
I am currently a NIH F99 Pre-Doctoral Fellow at the University of Vermont focused on advancing machine learning for early-lung cancer detection. Previously award a NIH F31 Pre-doctoral award, and a T-32 pre-doctoral fellowship from the Vermont Lung Center. I have published on the application of discrete wavelet decomposition for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve network generalizability and Sleep Apnea detection using artificial neural networks (ANNs).  

In addition I act as a advisor and machine learning expert for Predictive Wear Inc. focusing on developing novel strategies to detect variability in physiological signals for continuous monitoring. Previously interned and contracted at Eli Lilly and Co. as an Automation Engineer.
